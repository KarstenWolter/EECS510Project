**Written description of schema:**
Terminal symbols: Explained in alphabet.txt

Non-terminal symbols: Explained in alphabet.txt

States:
startAction(state 1, start state): This is the starting state of the automaton. It represents waiting for the action 'dribble'
actionSequence(state 2): After 'dribble', the automaton transition to this state, where actions are repeated as many times as necessary
endPlayAction(state 3, accepting state): This is the accepting state that is transitioned into if there is a steal, turnover, or a shotOutcome occurs without a follow up rebound
freeThrowSequence(state 4, accepting state): This is the accepting state that is transitioned into if there was a foul called, which should be followed by a freeThrowOutcome

Transitions: 
State 1 to state 2: This occurs when the symbol dribble is used
State 2 to state 2: This occurs when an action is performed such as pass, shotAttempt, 'shotAttempt miss rebound'. And the grammar allows for a loop.
State 2 to state 3: This occurs when something unrelated to the action loop happens such as a 'steal' or 'turnover'. But, this also occurs when action shotAttempt is NOT followed by 'miss rebound'.
State 2 to state 4: This occurs when a foul is called in the string, according to the rules 'foul' should always be followed up with a freeThrowOutcome (zeroMade, oneMade, twoMade)
