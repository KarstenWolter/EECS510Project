Preface: 
This language is based off of the game of Basketball. Strings in this language are refered to as 'plays'. A play last as long as possession is first obtained to
either the ball being 'turned over'(lost possession) to the opposing team or until point(s) are scored for the users team.
Rules:
1. Every play must start with 'dribble'.
2. Every play may contain any amount of actions, even zero.
3. The play must end with an 'endPlayAction'(steal, turnover, shotOutcome) or the 'freeThrowSequence' which is initiated by using the 'foul' action.
4. A shotAttempt must be followed by a valid outcome.
    • End the play with 'scored' or 'miss'
    • A miss can be followed up with 'rebound' to maintain possession of the ball (e.g. 'shoot2pt miss rebound shoot3pt')
5. A shotOutcome requires a shotAttempt to be taken immediately before its called.
    • 'dribble scored' is invalid because no shot was attempted
6. A valid play cannot be ended prematurely.
    • 'dribble shoot2pt' is invalid because it lacks a shot outcome
    • 'dribble pass' is invalid because it requires an endPlayAction
7. No further actions may be taken after an endPlayAction.
    • The play is terminated once an endPlayAction occurs
8. A 'foul' will disallow any further actions to be made and will trigger 'freeThrowSequence' which is followed up by stating a freeThrowOutcome, resulting in the end of the play.
    • e.g. dribble shoot2pt miss rebound foul oneMade *end*
